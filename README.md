This is the source code to accompany my YouTube video, “How to build a UICollectionView like the App Store”, where I walk through how to build something like the App Store using features introduced in iOS 13 such as UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.

**You can watch the video here: https://youtu.be/SR7DtcT61tA**

There are some limitations stated in the video, and it’s worth repeating them here: 

1. We’re not making the whole App Store, just the collection view part.
2. I don’t have Apple’s code, so everything you see here is made by me running the App Store on my phone and comparing it with my project.
3. There are lots of shortcuts so that I could fit it all into a 45-minute talk – magic numbers, guesswork, and support for iPhone 11 Pro Max only.

If you’d like to improve this project, go for it – please open a pull request with your changes and I’ll merge it in!
